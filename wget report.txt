Wget is a computer tool created by the GNU Project. You can use it to retrieve content and files from various web servers. The name is a combination of World Wide Web and the word get. It supports downloads via FTP, SFTP, HTTP, and HTTPS.

Wget is created in portable C and usable on any Unix system. It’s also possible to implement on Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, AmigaOS and other popular platforms.

Some of its feature are:-
*Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while the user is not logged on. This allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work. By contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user’s presence, which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.
*Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the original site. This is sometimes referred to as “recursive downloading.” While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard (/robots.txt). Wget can be instructed to convert the links in downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline viewing.
*Wget supports proxy servers, which can lighten the network load, speed up retrieval and provide access behind firewalls. Wget uses the passive FTP downloading by default, active FTP being an option.
*Wget supports IP version 6, the next generation of IP. IPv6 is autodetected at compile-time, and can be disabled at either build or run time. Binaries built with IPv6 support work well in both IPv4-only and dual family environments.
*GNU Wget is free software. This means that everyone may use it, redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as published by the Free Software Foundation

Invoking Wget:-
By default, Wget is very simple to invoke. The basic syntax is:
    wget [option]… [URL]…
Wget will simply download all the URLs specified on the command line. URL is a Uniform Resource Locator

Option syntax:-
Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every option has a long form along with the short one. Long options are more convenient to remember, but take time to type. You may freely mix different option styles, or specify options after the command-line arguments. Thus you may write:
    wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log
The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may be omitted.You may put several options that do not require arguments togethe, eg:-
    wget -drc URL instead of wget -d -r -c URL
    
    
Explanation of the various flags:
* ‘-V’,‘--version’ : Display the version of Wget.
* ‘-b’,‘--background’ : Go to background immediately after startup. If no output file is specified via the ‘-o’, output is redirected to wget-log.
* ‘-e command’,‘--execute command’ : Execute command as if it were a part of .wgetrc (see Startup File). A command thus invoked will be executed after the commands in .wgetrc, thus taking precedence over them. If you need to specify more than one wgetrc command, use multiple instances of ‘-e’.

* ‘-o logfile’,‘--output-file=logfile’ : Log all messages to logfile. The messages are normally reported to standard error.
* ‘-a logfile’,‘--append-output=logfile’ : Append to logfile. This is the same as ‘-o’, only it appends to logfile instead of overwriting the old log file. If logfile does not exist, a new file is created.
* --mirror – Makes (among other things) the download recursive.
* --convert-links – convert all the links (also to stuff like CSS stylesheets) to relative, so it will be suitable for offline viewing.
* --adjust-extension – Adds suitable extensions to filenames (html or css) depending on their content-type.
* --page-requisites – Download things like CSS style-sheets and images required to properly display the page offline.
* --no-parent – When recursing do not ascend to the parent directory. It useful for restricting the download to only a portion of the site.
* ‘--input-metalink=file’
Downloads files covered in local Metalink file. Metalink version 3 and 4 are supported.
* ‘-c’,‘--continue’ : Continue getting a partially-downloaded file. This is useful when you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or by another program.
* ‘--show-progress’ : Force wget to display the progress bar in any verbosity.
